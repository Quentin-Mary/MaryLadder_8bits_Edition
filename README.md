# MaryLadder 8 bits Edition V1.0

A pocket-sized 8-bits adder/subtractor PCB with a decimal display


## Features

- A & B inputs as 8 bits numbers with switches and LEDs
- 8 bits adder / subtractor (selection with a switch)
- 7 segments display with 3 digits to see A, B or S (sum) in decimal
- Type-C connector for 5V input


## FAQ

####  How was this project born?

The MaryLadder - 8 bits Edition born in my mind 3 years ago,
when during my electronic engineering studies (at ESEO Angers, in France), 
I had the chance to participate in courses on logic gates. In order to 
make us understand the functioning of basic computers, we had to create
an 8 bits adder on breadboard. Tons of wires and pain for the sole purpose
of displaying a counter from 0 to 9 on a 7 segment display, without cheating
using a microcontroller.

This was my first real experience in electronics, where I discovered a sense of
wonder about these ICs.   

#### What's the purpose of this project?

The realization of this PCB project is important to me.
First of all, because my very own projet, I designed everything from electrical
diagram, to placement, routing and even embedded software.
Through this project, I tried to prove to myself what I was capable of.
